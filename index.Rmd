Three day summer school on basics of high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing data analysis. This summer school is organised in collaboration with [Laboratory of Microbiology](https://www.wur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Agrotechnology-and-Food-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Microbiology.htm), [Systems and Synthetic Biology](https://www.wur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Agrotechnology-and-Food-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Systems-and-Synthetic-Biology.htm), Wageningen University & Research, the Netherlands and [Department of Mathematics and Statistics University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/units/sci/units/math/Pages/home.aspx), Finland. This year it will be held at [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm). We will cover topics related to basics of sequencing and microbial community analysis. We will use [NG-Tax]( https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1791/v1) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) based tools like [Phyloseq](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061217), [microbiome](http://microbiome.github.io/microbiome/) and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) for downstream data analysis and visualization.   

### Focus of summer school:
The primary aim is introduce microbial community data analysis. There will be talks and discussion on theory and methodology for analysis of microbial community data. We will cover topics ranging from design of studies, sequencing technologies, importance of controls and standardized DNA processing. Supervised hands-on training covering analyses from raw reads using NG-Tax, downstream analysis in R for exploration and analysis of microbiome sequencing data will be priority. There will be a strong focus on using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for moving towards reproducible and open science.    

### Target applicants:
Anyone who plans to *or* is currently doing high throughput microbial community analysis.  
No prior knowledge of R software is required.  

### Location:  
The summer school will be organised in Wageningen University & Research, The Netherlands. 

Additional details are forthcoming.
